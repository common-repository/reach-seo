Reach SEO provides tools for reaching your target audience directly. This plugin focuses on external outreach such as the broken link building technique.

== Description ==

This plugin helps you reach new audiences straight from the WordPress admin. You can easily find new opportunities to promote and reach your target audience from the context of your blog post.

= Current Features =

* Generate outreach opportunities/leads from the following campaign types:

> **Broken Links**: We find broken links around the web with similar content. This is a very white hat method for increasing your overall site/page ranking.

> **Backlinks (Contextual Content)**: We find links pointing to similar content as yours. Often times you can ask for links by providing a similar but improved or updated resource.

> **Relevant Contacts**: Put your content in the hands of the right people. These are people who may enjoy the content on your site, and are more likely to view and/or share that content.

* Outreach Mode let's you send out emails straight to the leads generated by above campaigns.

* Default email templates for each outreach campaign.

* Ability to create your own dynamic email templates using Handlebars.

* Email finder. We attempt to gather potential emails for each outreach opportunity, saving you valuable time in the process! You **will** need to do your own searching at some point, however.

Note: minimum requirement of WordPress v3.5 due to $wpdb->get_charset_collate() [link](https://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_Tables_with_Plugins).

This plugin relies on an external API. Grab your free API key from the official site: [reachseo.io](http://www.reachseo.io).

In order to send outreach emails from your gmail account, you need to enable "Allow less secure apps" from your gmail [account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security?#connectedapps) page, or more specifically [here](https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps). Next you will need to update the Reach SEO settings page with the following:

1. Host: smtp.gmail.com
2. Port: 465
3. Encryption: SSL
4. Username: (your gmail account)
5. Password: (your gmail account password)

Outlook:

1. Host: smtp-mail.outlook.com
2. Port: 587
3. Encryption: TLS
4. Username: (full outlook email address)
5. Password: (outlook account password)

Note that your account credentials are stored in your WordPress database, and are only as secure as such. If you feel that your site has been compromised, please take the pre-caution of changing your email accounts password! We are working on a more secure option for a future release.
